This simplifies the organization and manipulation of mapping data, making tasks like creating, importing, exporting, and copying mappings straightforward. Whether dealing with complex data or programming, "Collections" provides a user-friendly way to handle mappings efficiently, ensuring a smooth workflow for users of all levels.
