# Collection Management

With DataMapper, you can create the collections easily and once the collection is created you would be able to create the mapping of data.

## Create the collection

1.  To create the collection go to the DataMapper and click on the create button under Collection.

    </div>
2.  Under **Create new collection** tab, provide the collection Name, Version, Name Space and Description. Once you have added the details, click on the **Create** to create the collection.

    </div>

    > **Note**: In the Name only underscore (\_) is allowed and only dot (.) is allowed in the Name Space of the collection from the special characters.
3.  Once the collection is created, you would be able to see it on the left hand side under the Collections.

4. You can click on the collection and explore it. You will find collection is empty and there is no mapping in that.

Click on [Mapping](Mapping.md) to learn about how to create the Mapping and map the source and target.
