## Global Variables
Boost data management efficiency by storing frequently accessed data as global variables. Create a central hub for commonly used data across different parts of the system. Use global variables strategically to streamline processes and enhance overall system efficiency. Utilize global variables as a smart strategy for efficient data access and management.

### Add Global Variables

1.  To create Global Variables, navigate to **Global** in the left-side menu or directly click on **Create** within the Global Variables section.

    > **Supported data types for variables includes String, Number and Boolean.** **Default values are mandatory when adding variables.**
3.  While adding the Source, incorporate additional **variables** into your **Mapping**.

That's how you can seamlessly include a **Variable Group** in your mapping process, ensuring consistency and efficiency. For further details, refer to the [Mapping](Mapping.md) section to explore the process of adding mappings to your Data Collections and leveraging these global variables to streamline your data integration efforts.
