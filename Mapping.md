# Mapping in Datamapper
Adding Source and Target Schemas to Start Mapping and Transform Your Data.
Mapping in Datamapper is a critical feature that allows you to connect and transform data between different schemas, often a source schema and a target schema. Here's what this involves:

## Source Schema:
The source schema represents the structure and format of the data as it is originally stored or received. It defines the fields, data types, and relationships within the data source.

## Target schema:
The target schema, on the other hand, defines the structure and format of the data as you want it to be after transformation. It specifies the desired fields, data types, and relationships in the transformed data.
